# Matrix Math for the Web
This content kit is meant to a brief overview of Linear Algebra (Matrix Math).
Matrix math is used heavily in WebGL, but Web Developers are more familiar with
DOM manipulation, so we'd like to divorce the explanation of matrix math from
the WebGL APIs by using matrix math with CSS3 transforms (matrix3d).

We'd like to show some basic CSS3 transforms, like translateX, and their
equivalents as a raw matrix passed to matrix3d.  This demystifies
transformations, and allows us to compose further matrices.  By composing
matrices we can explain concepts like matrix multiplication.
